# On regular Linux one can run gh auth login, and it will run a browser. On WSL one might need to use github-cli as follows:
# gh auth login --with-token < fromfile.txt
# It is assumed that the personal access token has access to the github workflow (and thus full access to all repo stuff), read:org, and gist
# The access token will then be saved in ~/.config/gh/
#
#[credential "https://github.com"]
